# Callbacks in Multiple Appliance Environments

In a {product-title} multiple appliance environment, enable the Embedded
Ansible server role on a dedicated {product-title\_short} appliance. Add
`store_session:sql` to Ansible playbooks to ensure successful callbacks
to {product-title\_short} appliances in a multiple appliance
environment.

In {product-title\_short}, a cloud provider is a cloud computing
environment that you can add to a {product-title\_short} appliance to
manage and interact with the resources in that environment. This chapter
describes the different types of cloud providers that you can add to
{product-title\_short}, and how to manage them. Most cloud providers are
added individually to {product-title\_short}. Additionally, Amazon EC2
and Azure cloud providers can be discovered automatically by
{product-title\_short}.

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent cloud providers.
Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic
information about each provider:

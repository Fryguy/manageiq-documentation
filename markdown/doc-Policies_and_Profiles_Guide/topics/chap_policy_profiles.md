Policy profiles are groups of policies that you can assign wholesale to
virtual machines, providers, clusters, hosts, resource pools,
replicators, pods, container nodes, and container images. Policy
profiles provide a framework for easily managing and assigning different
levels of security, across various types of cloud resources.

# Simulating Policy

Before assigning a policy profile to a virtual machine, use the
{product-title} controls policy simulation feature to determine if a
virtual machine passes a policy profile.

# Assigning Policy Profiles

After creating your policy profiles, you are ready to evaluate and
assign them.

  - Assign a policy profile to a virtual machine to apply the policy
    profile to a specific virtual machine, independent of its related
    host, provider, or repository.

  - Assign a policy profile to a provider to apply the policy profile to
    all virtual machines, hosts, replicators, pods, container nodes or
    container images registered to that provider.

  - Assign a policy profile to a replicator to apply the policy profile
    to that specific replicator.

  - Assign a policy profile to a pod to apply the policy profile to that
    specific pod.

  - Assign a policy profile to a container node to apply the policy
    profile to that specific node.

  - Assign a policy profile to a container image to apply the policy
    profile to that specific image.

  - Assign a policy profile to a cluster to apply the policy profile to
    all virtual machines or hosts assigned to that cluster.

  - Assign a VM policy profile to a host to apply the policy profile to
    that specific host or all virtual machines registered to that host.

  - Assign a VM policy profile to a resource pool to apply the policy
    profile to all virtual machines or hosts assigned to that resource
    pool.

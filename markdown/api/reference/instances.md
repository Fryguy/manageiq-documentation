## Targeting Instances

These actions can be triggered on individual instance resources:

``` data
/api/instances/:id
```

As simply as POSTing the following action to an instance.

``` json
{
  "action" : "start"
}
```

Requests can also be made on multiple instances by targeting the primary
collection:

``` data
/api/instances
```

``` json
{
  "action" : "start",
  "resources" : [
    { "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/instances/101" },
    { "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/instances/102" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Querying Instances

Instances are queried via the primary collection URL:

``` data
/api/instances
```

Filtering, sorting and paging as mentioned on the
[Querying](../overview/query.html) page.

### Load Balancers

Load Balancers of an instance can be queried via the load\_balancers
subcollection as follows:

Query all Load Balancers of an instance:

``` data
GET /api/instances/:id/load_balancers
```

Query a specific Load Balancer of an instance:

``` data
GET /api/instances/:id/load_balancers/:load_balancer_id
```

Or expanding the Load Balancers for the specific instance as follows:

``` data
GET /api/instances/:id?expand=load_balancers
```

## Starting an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "start"
}
```

## Stopping an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "stop"
}
```

## Suspending an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "suspend"
}
```

## Pausing an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "pause"
}
```

## Terminating an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "terminate"
}
```

## Shelving an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "shelve"
}
```

## Rebooting Guest in an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "reboot-guest"
}
```

## Resetting an Instance

``` json
{
  "action" : "reset"
}
```

# Placement of Environmental Variables in Provisioning Requests

Pass environment values directly through the `vm_fields` attribute group
of a provisioning request by first adding `"placement_auto":"false"` to
the hash.

<div class="note">

Once `"placement_auto:"false"` has been added, you must pass values for
all the required fields on the Environment tab.

</div>

The example request displays how the `vm_fields` attribute group should
appear when passing environment values.

## Request:

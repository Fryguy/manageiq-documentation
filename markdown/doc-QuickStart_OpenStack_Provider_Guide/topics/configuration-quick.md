# Configuring a Database for {product-title}

{product-title} supports the use of an internal or external database.
The following instructions are suitable for configuring an *internal*
database. For instructions on how to configure an external database
instead, see [Configuring an External
Database](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.1/single/installing-red-hat-cloudforms-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-openstack-platform#configuring_an_external_database).

<div class="important">

Before installing an internal database, add a disk to the infrastructure
hosting your appliance. See the documentation specific to your
infrastructure for instructions for adding a disk. As a storage disk
usually cannot be added while a virtual machine is running, Red Hat
recommends adding the disk before starting the appliance.
{product-title} only supports installing of an internal VMDB on blank
disks; installation will fail if the disks are not blank.

</div>

1.  Start the appliance and open a terminal console.

2.  Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {product-title} appliance
    summary screen displays.

3.  Press **Enter** to manually configure settings.

4.  Select **Configure Database** from the menu.

5.  You are prompted to create or fetch an encryption key.
    
      - If this is the first {product-title} appliance, choose **Create
        key**.
    
      - If this is not the first {product-title} appliance, choose
        **Fetch key from remote machine** to fetch the key from the
        first appliance. For worker and multi-region setups, use this
        option to copy key from another appliance.
        
        <div class="note">
        
        All {product-title\_short} appliances in a multi-region
        deployment must use the same key.
        
        </div>

6.  Choose **Create Internal Database** for the database location.

7.  Choose a disk for the database. This can be either a disk you
    attached previously, or a partition on the current disk.
    
    <div class="important">
    
    Red Hat recommends using a separate disk for the database.
    
    </div>
    
    If there is an unpartitioned disk attached to the virtual machine,
    the dialog will show options similar to the following:
    
        1) /dev/vdb: 20480
        2) Don't partition the disk
    
      - Enter **1** to choose `/dev/vdb` for the database location. This
        option creates a logical volume using this device and mounts the
        volume to the appliance in a location appropriate for storing
        the database. The default location is `/var/lib/pgsql`, which
        can be found in the environment variable
        `$APPLIANCE_PG_MOUNT_POINT`.
    
      - Enter **2** to continue without partitioning the disk. A second
        prompt will confirm this choice. Selecting this option results
        in using the root filesystem for the data directory (not advised
        in most cases).

8.  Enter **Y** or **N** for **Should this appliance run as a standalone
    database server?**
    
      - Select **Y** to configure the appliance as a database-only
        appliance. As a result, the appliance is configured as a basic
        PostgreSQL server, without a user interface.
    
      - Select **N** to configure the appliance with the full
        administrative user interface.

9.  When prompted, enter a unique number to create a new region.
    
    <div class="important">
    
    Creating a new region destroys any existing data on the chosen
    database.
    
    </div>

10. Create and confirm a password for the database.

{product-title} then configures the internal database. This takes a few
minutes. After the database is created and initialized, you can log in
to {product-title\_short}.

# Configuring General {product-title} Settings

After configuring the general settings for the appliance and creating a
database for it, you can now launch {product-title}. To do this, use the
**Start EVM Server Processes** option from the appliance console
([Configuring General Appliance
Settings](#configuring_general_appliance_settings)). Once you launch
{product-title}, note the **Hostname** and **IP Address** displayed on
the appliance console screen.

Open the {product-title} web-based user interface by accessing either
**Hostname** and **IP Address** on a web browser. At the login screen,
use the following credentials:

  - Username: **admin**

  - Password: **smartvm**

<div class="note">

You can also change the password of the **admin** account from the login
screen. To do so, click the **Update Password** link.

</div>

You can access and configure most {product-title} settings through the
**Configuration** menu. You can access this menu through **Administrator
| EVM** \> **Configuration**.

The options under the ![Configuration](config-gear.png)
**Configuration** menu allow you to configure global options for your
{product-title} environment, view diagnostic information, and view
analytics on the servers in the environment. The menu displays the
{product-title} environment at the enterprise, zone, and server levels.

There are four main areas:

  - **Settings**
    
    This menu allows you to configure global settings for your
    {product-title} infrastructure. You can also create analysis
    profiles and schedules for these profiles.

  - **Access Control**
    
    This menu contains options for configuring users, groups, roles, and
    tenants.

  - **Diagnostics**
    
    This menu displays the status of your servers and their roles and
    provides access to logs.

  - **Database**
    
    specify the location of your Virtual Machine Database (VMDB) and its
    login credentials.

# Configuring {product-title\_short} Metrics for SmartState Analysis

You can also configure {product-title\_short} to perform a *SmartState
Analysis*. This type of analysis collects details such as accounts,
drivers, network information, hardware, and security patches on assets
managed by the OpenStack provider. Enabling SmartState Analysis involves
two steps:

1.  [Configuring {product-title\_short} Capacity and
    Utilization](#cf-caputils), and

2.  [Enabling SmartState Analysis](#cf-smartproxy)

These steps are required to allow {product-title\_short} to collect
metrics from OpenStack and use them to perform a SmartState analysis.
You can choose different servers to perform either function; the
following sections assume that you will.

## Configuring {product-title\_short} Capacity and Utilization

For metrics collection to work properly, you also need to configure
{product-title} to allow for all three **Capacity & Utilization** server
roles, which are available from the settings menu under
menu:Configuration\[Server \> Server Control\].

To enable these server roles:

1.  Click **Configuration**, then select the server to configure from
    menu:Settings\[Zone\] in the accordion menu on the left.

2.  Navigate to the **Server Roles** list in the menu:Server\[Server
    Control\] section. From there, set the required capacity and
    utilization roles to **ON**, namely:
    
    1.  **Capacity & Utilization Coordinator**
    
    2.  **Capacity & Utilization Data Collector**
    
    3.  **Capacity & Utilization Data Processor**

3.  Click **Save**.

Data collection is enabled immediately. However, the first collection
begins 5 minutes after the server is started, and every 10 minutes after
that. Therefore, the longest the collection takes after enabling the
Capacity & Utilization Collector role is 10 minutes. The first
collection from a particular provider may take a few minutes since
{product-title} is gathering data points going one month back in time.

For more information, see [Capacity and Utilization
Collection](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.1/deployment-planning-guide/#capacity_and_utilization_collection)
from the *Deployment Planning Guide*.

## Enabling SmartState Analysis

After enabling the required server roles, enable SmartState analysis.
See [Smart State Analysis
Support](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/support_matrix/#smart_state_analysis_support)
from the Support Matrix and [Running a SmartState
Analysis](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#running-a-smartstate-analysis)
in the *Managing Providers* guide for more information.

Enabling SmartState analysis is similar to [Configuring
{product-title\_short} Capacity and Utilization](#cf-caputils), in that
the procedure also involves enabling server roles on a specific server.
To do so:

1.  Click i\*Configuration\*.

2.  Select the server to configure from menu:Settings\[Zone\] in the
    left pane of the appliance.

3.  Navigate to the **Server Roles** list in the menu:Server\[Server
    Control\] section. From there, set the appropriate SmartState roles
    to **ON**. Namely:
    
    1.  **SmartProxy**
    
    2.  **SmartState Analysis**

4.  Click **Save**.

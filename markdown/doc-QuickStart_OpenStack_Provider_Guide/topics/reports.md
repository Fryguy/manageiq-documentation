{product-title} provides a large group of default reports organized into
categories. Each category has its own set of subfolders. These reports
have been constructed to help you view the most commonly requested and
significant data.

The categories of predefined reports available on {product-title} are:

  - **Configuration Management**: hardware, application, network,
    service, user account, operating system, and snapshot information
    for all of your items.

  - **Migration Readiness**: information related to items required to
    migrate a virtual machine.

  - **Operations**: free space on registered and unregistered virtual
    machines, power states for virtual machines, and SmartState analysis
    status.
    
    This category also provides reports relating to the operation of
    {product-title}, such as user IDs and snapshots taken by
    {product-title}.

  - **VM Sprawl**: usage information and disk waste.

  - **Relationships**: virtual machine, folder, and cluster
    relationships.

  - **Events**: operations and configuration management events.

  - **Performance by Asset Type**: performance of your virtual
    infrastructure.
    
    You must be capturing capacity and utilization data to get this
    information.

  - **Running Processes**: information on processes running on a virtual
    machine.
    
    You must have domain credentials entered for the zone to collect the
    information for these reports, and the virtual machine must have
    been analyzed at least once.

  - **Trending**: projections of datastore capacity, along with host CPU
    and memory use.

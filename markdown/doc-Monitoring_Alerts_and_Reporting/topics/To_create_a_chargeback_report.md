# Creating a Chargeback Report

{product-title} allows you to create chargeback reports to monitor costs
you charged.

<div class="note">

When creating a chargeback report, the **Total Cost** is the complete
cost for the chosen workload over the selected time frame. Total costs
are calculated by adding the calculated costs for the amount used and
the amount allocated for the time frame. When adding cost related
columns to display on your report, be sure to select all rate assigned
fields to present a comprehensive accounting of total costs.

You can prepare the VMware virtual machines for migration.

1.  Download and install [VMware
    Tools](https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/new_guest_tools_ws.html)
    to preserve the IP addresses.

2.  Unmount mounted ISO/CDROM disks.

3.  Ensure that each NIC has no more than one IPv4 and/or one IPv6
    address.

4.  Ensure that the virtual machine names contain only upper- or
    lower-case letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), or
    periods (`.`).

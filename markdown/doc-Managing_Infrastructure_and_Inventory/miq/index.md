## Detecting Drift on Clusters

Over time, a clusterâ€™s configuration might change. Drift is the
comparison of a cluster to itself at different points in time. The
cluster requires analysis at least twice to collect information.
Detecting drift provides users with the following benefits:

  - See the difference between the last known state of a cluster and its
    current state

  - Review the configuration changes that happen to a particular cluster
    between multiple points in time.

  - Capture the configuration drifts for a single cluster across a time
    period.

Detect drift on clusters:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Clusters</span>.

2.  Click on the cluster to view drift.

3.  Click **Relationships** in the cluster accordion.

4.  Click **Drift History**.

## Performing SmartState Analysis on Hosts

Perform a SmartState analysis on a host to collect additional
information about it, such as patches, CPU, and memory.

<div class="note">

  - SmartState analysis on hosts is processed by the **Provider
    Operations** role. It is enabled by default.

  - For ESX or ESXi hypervisors, consider the following: ESX hosts
    utilize a service console for host management and can be accessed
    using SSH. ESXi hosts lack a service console and therefore SSH
    cannot be used to obtain information sets for patches, services,
    Linux packages, user groups, SSH Config, and FS Files.

  - `root` or administrator credentials are required to get patch
    information.

</div>

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Hosts</span>.

2.  Check the hosts to analyze.

3.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1942](images/1942.png)(**Perform SmartState Analysis**).

4.  Click **OK**.

## Comparing Hosts

### Using the Host Comparison Sections

The following procedure describes how to use the host comparison
sections.

1.  On the left of a comparison screen, select the categories of
    properties to display.

2.  Click the plus sign next to the sections name to expand it.

3.  The following descriptions pertain to the **Expanded View**
    ![2023](images/2023.png). Either the value of a property or an icon
    representing the property displays depending on the properties type.
    
      - A property displayed in the same color as the base means that
        the compared host matches the base for that property.
    
      - A property displayed in a different color from the base means
        that the compared host does not match the base for that
        property.

4.  If you are in the **Compressed View** ![2024](images/2024.png), the
    values of the properties do not display. All items are described by
    the icons shown below.
    
      - A ![2150](images/2150.png) (**checkmark**) means the compared
        host matches the base for that property. Hover over it and the
        value of the property displays.
    
      - A ![2151](images/2151.png) (**x**) means the compared host does
        not match the base for that property. Hover over it and the
        value of the property displays.

5.  Click the plus sign next to the section name to collapse it.

This comparison is viewable in multiple ways. Export the data or create
a report from your comparison for analysis using external tools.

### Creating a Host Comparison Report

Create a quick report to compare clusters in CSV, TXT, or PDF formats.

1.  Create the comparison to analyze.

2.  Click ![2107](images/2107.png) (**Download**).

3.  Click the output button for the type of report.
    
      - Click ![2133](images/2133.png) (**Download comparison report in
        TXT format**) for a text file.
    
      - Click ![2133](images/2133.png) (**Download comparison report in
        CSV format**) for a comma-separated file.
    
      - Click ![2134](images/2134.png) (**Download comparison report in
        PDF format**) for a PDF file.

## Refreshing Multiple Hosts

Manually refresh a host for its properties and related infrastructure
components.

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Hosts</span>.

2.  Check the hosts to refresh.

3.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![2003](images/2003.png) (**Refresh Relationships and Power
    States**).

4.  Click **OK**.

When a host is refreshed and a new virtual machine is discovered on that
host, ManageIQ checks to see if the virtual machine is already
registered with another host. If this is the case, the host that the
virtual machine is associated with switches to the new host. If the
SmartProxy is monitoring a provider, this happens automatically. If not,
the next refresh of the host addresses this.

## Discovering Multiple Hosts

If not using a provider, use ManageIQâ€™s Discovery to find hosts in your
environment within a range of IP addresses.

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Hosts</span>.

2.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then click
    ![1942](images/1942.png) (**Discover items**).

3.  Check the types of hosts to discover: `ESX` or `IPMI`.

4.  Type in a range of **IP Addresses**.
    
    ![2213](images/2213.png)

5.  Click **Start**.

ManageIQ searches for the supported hosts. When available, the new hosts
display. They are named by hostname and IP address. To make them
identifiable, edit the basic information for each host.

## Adding a Single Host

To analyze a host for more detailed information, add it to the VMDB
first. If the host has not been found during **Host Discovery** or
**Provider Refresh**, and the hostâ€™s IP address is known, use the **Add
a New Host** button.

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Hosts</span>.

2.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then click
    ![1862](images/1862.png) (**Add a New item**).

3.  Type the **Name**, **Host Name**, and **IP Address** of the host to
    add. **Name** is how the device is labeled in the console. Select
    the type of operating system from the **Host Platform** dropdown. If
    the Host has been found during **Discovery** or **Refresh** and the
    hostâ€™s operating system has been identified, the **Host Platform**
    selector remains disabled. If adding an IPMI server for
    provisioning, add in the IP address of that host.
    
    <div class="important">
    
    The **Host Name** must use a unique fully qualified domain name.
    
    </div>
    
    ![2214](images/2214.png)

4.  In the **Credentials** box, the **Default** tab provides fields to
    type a user name with elevated security credentials and the userâ€™s
    password. If using domain credentials, the format for **User ID** is
    in the format of `[domainname]\[username]`. On ESX hosts, if the
    `SSH` login is disabled for the **Default** user, type in a user
    with remote login access on the **Remote Login** tab.
    
    ![2215](images/2215.png)

5.  Click **Validate** to check the credentials.

6.  Click **Save**.

## Editing Hosts

If multiple hosts have the same settings or credentials, edit them at
the same time.

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Hosts</span>.

2.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**).

3.  Check the Hosts to edit.

4.  Click ![1851](images/1851.png) (**Edit Selected items**).

5.  Use **Credentials** to provide login credentials required for this
    host.
    
    ![2216](images/2216.png)
    
      - On the **Default** tab, type a user name with elevated security
        credentials and the users password. If you are using domain
        credentials, the format for User ID must be in the format of
        `[domainname]\[username]`.
    
      - On `ESX` hosts, if `SSH` login is disabled for the **Default**
        user, type in a user with remote login access on the **Remote
        Login** tab. If this is not supplied, *Default* credentials will
        be used.
    
      - Use **Web Services** to supply credentials for any web service
        calls made directly to the host system. If this is not supplied,

## Scaling Down Compute Hosts

Through ManageIQ, you can perform a *Compute scale down* on a Red Hat
OpenStack infrastructure provider. This process involves decreasing its
Compute nodes used by an OpenStack infrastructure provider. Doing so
involves putting a Compute node into *maintenance mode* and removing it
from the provider afterwards. Once a node is in maintenance mode, it can
be repurposed (for examle, re-provision it as a Controller node),
repaired, or decommissioned altogether.

Before scaling down, evacuate or migrate any instances hosted on the
node you are removing. For instructions on either procedure, see
[Migrating a Live Instance](#_to_live_migrate_an_instance) or
[Evacuating an Instance](#_to_evacuate_an_instance).

After migrating or evacuating instances from the node, set the node to
maintenance mode. To do so:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Hosts</span>.

2.  Click the OpenStack compute node to be removed from the provider.

3.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1851](images/1851.png) (**Toggle Maintenance Mode**).
    
    <div class="note">
    
    This option can only be used with OpenStack providers with at least
    two Compute nodes.
    
    </div>

Repeat this procedure for every node you want to remove from the cloud
provider.

After setting a Compute node to maintenance mode, you can scale down its
provider:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Providers</span>.

2.  Click the provider to be scaled down.

3.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1851](images/1851.png) (**Scale Down**).

4.  From the **Scale Infrastructure Provider Down** section, check the
    nodes to be removed from the provider. You can only do this for
    nodes where **Maintenance** is set to **true**.

5.  Click **Scale Down**.

## Refreshing Relationships and Power States for a Host

## Detecting Drift on Hosts

Over time, the configuration of a host might change. Drift is the
comparison of a host to itself at different points in time. The host
requires analysis at least twice to collect information. Detecting drift
provides you the following benefits:

  - See the difference between the last known state of a host and its
    current state.

  - Review the configuration changes that happen to a particular host
    between multiple points in time.

  - Capture the configuration drifts for a single host across a time
    period.

Detect drift on hosts:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Hosts</span>.

2.  Click on the host to view drift.

3.  Click **Relationships** in the host accordion.

4.  Click **Drift History**.

5.  Check the analyses to compare.

6.  Click ![1946](images/1946.png) (**Drift**) at the top of the screen.
    The results display.

7.  Check the **Comparison** sections on the left to view in your
    comparison.

8.  Click **Apply**.

9.  Click the plus sign next to the sections name to expand it.
    
      - An item displayed on red text shows a change from the base
        analysis. An item displayed in black text shows no change from
        the base analysis.
    
      - A ![2177](images/2177.png) (**Changed from previous**) shows a
        change since the last analysis.
    
      - A ![2150](images/2150.png) (**Same as previous**) means no
        change since the last analysis.
    
      - Click ![1861](images/1861.png) (**Remove from drift**) at the
        bottom of a column to remove a specific analysis. The drift
        recalculates and the new results display.

10. Click ![2023](images/2023.png) (**Expanded View**) to see the
    expanded view. Click ![2024](images/2024.png) (**Compressed View**)
    to compress the information.

11. Click the minus sign next to the sections name to collapse it.

12. To limit the type of views, you have three buttons in the taskbar:
    
      - Click ![2178](images/2178.png) (**All attributes**) to see all
        attributes of the sections you selected.
    
      - Click ![2204](images/2204.png) (**Attributes with different
        values**) to see only the attributes that are different across
        the drifts.
    
      - Click ![2148](images/2148.png) (**Attributes with the same
        values**) to see only the attributes that are the same across
        drifts.

# Virtual Machines

The heterogeneous virtual machine container and guest support combined
with the ability to analyze information inside the virtual machine -
such as disk space, patch level or installed applications - provides
in-depth information across the virtual environment. This rich set of
information enables ManageIQ users to improve problem resolution times
and effectively manage virtual machines.

The **Virtual Machines** pages display all virtual machines that were
discovered by your server. Note that if you have applied a filter to a
user, it will be in effect here. The **Virtual Machines** taskbar is a
menu driven set of buttons that provide access to functions related to
virtual machines.

| ![2139](images/2139.png) | Retired: When a virtual machine or instance is no longer required, it can be retired. Once a virtual machine or instance reaches its retirement date and time, it is immediately shut down and not allowed to restart. If an attempt to restart is made, ManageIQ will shut down the virtual machine or instance.                                                                                                                         |
| ![2140](images/2140.png) | Archived: An archived virtual machine has no host or datastore associated with it. Archiving is done to move virtual machines to a low cost storage, either on demand or during retirement, if requested, to avoid incurring extra cost on a virtualized infrastructure due to virtual machine sprawl.                                                                                                                                    |
| ![2141](images/2141.png) | Orphaned: An orphaned virtual machine has no host but has a datastore associated with it. Orphaned virtual machines are those that have been removed from their providers but still exist on the storage. An orphaned virtual machine is unable to identify the associated host. A virtual machine also shows as orphaned if it exists on a different host than the host expected by the providerâ€™s server.                               |
| ![2142](images/2142.png) | Disconnected: A disconnected virtual machine is one that has lost connection to either the providerâ€™s storage, host, or both. A disconnect is usually a result of network issues on the provider side. For instance, if during virtual machine provisioning the storage is not set up or deleted, the virtual machine will still exist on the provider, but will not run on the host as it has lost connection to its providerâ€™s storage. |
| ![2143](images/2143.png) | On: Virtual Machine is powered on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Analyzing Virtual Machines and Templates

Analyze a virtual machine to collect metadata such as user accounts,
applications, software patches, and other internal information. If
ManageIQ is not set up for automatic analysis, perform a manual analysis
of a virtual machine. To perform a SmartState analysis, ManageIQ
requires a running SmartProxy with visibility to the virtual machineâ€™s
storage location. If the virtual machine is associated with a host or
provider, ensure the virtual machine is registered with that system to
be properly analyzed; the server requires this information since a
snapshot might be created.

<div class="note">

SmartState Analysis of a virtual machine requires access to its host. To
perform a successful analysis, edit the virtual machineâ€™s host and enter
the hostâ€™s authentication credentials.

</div>

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Virtual Machines</span>.

2.  Click the accordion for the items to analyze.

3.  Check the **Virtual Machines** and **Templates** to analyze.

### Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Prerequisites

#### SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1 and Above - Storage Support Notes

Note the following requirements when performing SmartState Analysis on
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1 and above.

  - NFS
    
      - The ManageIQ appliance requires a mount to the NFS datastore.

  - iSCSI / FCP
    
      - For Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.1 and 3.2, clusters must
        use full Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts and not Red Hat
        Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor hosts. You can use either
        type of host in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.3 and above.
    
      - Each ManageIQ appliance performing SmartState Analysis requires
        sharable, non-bootable DirectLUN access to each attached
        iSCSI/FCP storage domain. In order to perform smart analysis,
        the appliance must mount the data storage as a DirectLUN disk.
    
      - A ManageIQ appliance **must** reside in each datacenter with the
        iSCSI / FCP storage type.

  - Other Notes
    
      - The **Edit Management Engine Relationship** option enables the
        VM SmartState Analysis job to determine the datacenter where a
        ManageIQ appliance is running and thus to identify what storage
        it has access to in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
        environment.
        
          - After setting up a ManageIQ appliance and performing a
            refresh of the provider, find the ManageIQ appliance in the
            **Virtual Machine** accordion list and view its summary
            screen.
        
          - Click <span class="menuchoice">Configuration \> Edit
            Management Engine Relationship</span>.
        
          - Select the server that relates to this instance of the
            ManageIQ appliance.

<div class="important">

If you attach a DirectLUN disk after configuring the ManageIQ database,
access the appliance in a terminal and run `pvscan` to detect the
DirectLUN disk. Alternatively, in ManageIQ 5.2.1 and above, you can
restart the appliance to detect the disk automatically.

</div>

#### SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 - Storage Support Notes

There are two additional steps required to perform a SmartState Analysis
on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 using `iSCSI` or `FCP`
storage. NFS storage does not have these requirements.

1.  Enable `DirectLUN` support for the host and ManageIQ appliance that
    performs the analysis.
    
      - Enable `DirectLUN` on host.
    
      - Enable `DirectLUN` on the ManageIQ appliance. To do this, edit
        the desired Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization storage and get
        the `LUNID` value. Then, on the ManageIQ appliance virtual
        machine in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization user interface,
        right-click and select <span class="menuchoice">Edit \> Custom
        Properties</span> and enter the following in the **Custom
        Properties** edit box:
        
            directlun=<LUN ID>:readonly
        
        If you have multiple storage domains, separate them by a comma,
        similar to:
        
            directlun=<LUN ID 1>:readonly,<LUN ID 2>:readonly,<LUN ID N>:readonly
        
        <div class="note">
        
        The ManageIQ appliance must reside in the same data center as
        the storage you are trying to connect. If you have multiple data
        centers with `iSCSI` or `FCP` storage, you need a ManageIQ
        appliance in each data center to support virtual machine
        scanning.
        
        </div>

2.  **Set Server Relationship** - This is required to allow the virtual
    machine SmartState analysis job to determine which data center a
    ManageIQ appliance is running and therefore identify what storage it
    has access to in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.
    
    1.  After setting up a ManageIQ appliance and performing a refresh
        of the Provider, find the ManageIQ appliance in the **Virtual
        Machine** accordion list and view its summary screen.
    
    2.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
        ![2146](images/2146.png)(**Edit Server Relationship**).
    
    3.  Select the server that relates to this instance of the ManageIQ
        appliance.

## Comparing Virtual Machines and Templates

The ManageIQ Server allows you to compare multiple virtual machines.
This allows you to see how different virtual machines are from their
original template. This helps detect missing patches, unmanaged user
accounts, or unauthorized services.

Use the comparison feature to:

  - Compare multiple virtual machines from different hosts.

  - Compare multiple virtual machines side-by-side.

  - Quickly see similarities and differences among multiple virtual
    machines and a base.

  - Narrow the comparison display to categories of properties.

  - Print or export in the comparison results to a PDF or CSV file.

Compare virtual machines and templates:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Infrastructure \>
    Virtual Machines</span>.

2.  Click the accordion for the items to analyze.

3.  Check the items to compare.

4.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (Configuration), and then

    displays in a compressed view with a limited set of properties
    listed.
    
    ![2149](images/2149.png)

5.  To delete an item from the comparison, click
    ![1861](images/1861.png)(Remove this item from Inventory) at the
    bottom of the items column. This option is only available when
    comparing more than two virtual machines.

6.  To view many items on one screen, go to a compressed view by
    clicking ![2024](images/2024.png) (Compressed View). To return to an
    expanded view, click ![2023](images/2023.png) (Expanded View).

7.  To limit the mode of the view, there are two buttons in the task
    bar.
    
      - Click ![2022](images/2022.png) (Details Mode) to see all details
        for an attribute.
    
      - Click ![2025](images/2025.png) (Exists Mode) to limit the view
        to if an attribute exists compared to the base or not. This only
        applies to attributes that can have a boolean property. For
        example, a user account exists or does not exist, or a piece of
        hardware that does or does not exist.

8.  To change the base virtual machine that all the others are compared
    to, click its label at the top of its column.

9.  To go to the summary screen for a virtual machine, click its Virtual
    Thumbnail or icon.

subcategory of the **Summary** to see more detail on that section.

<div class="note">

When you perform a SmartState Analysis on a virtual machine or template,
you get more detailed information in these categories.

</div>

  - **Properties** include information such as the base operating
    system, hostname, IP addresses, Virtual Machine vendor, CPU
    Affinity, devices attached to the system, and snapshots. This
    includes the ability to analyze multiple partitions, multiple disks,
    Linux logical volumes, extended partitions, and Windows drives. Some
    categories can be clicked on for additional detail. For example,
    click **Container** to view notes associated with a virtual machine.

## Detecting Drift on Virtual Machines or Templates

The configuration of a virtual machine might change over time. **Drift**
is the comparison of a virtual machine to itself at different points in
time. The virtual machine needs analysis at least twice to collect this
information. Detecting drift provides you the following benefits:

  - See the difference between the last known state of a machine and its
    current state.

  - Review the configuration changes that happen to a particular virtual
    machine between multiple points in time.

  - Review the host and datastore association changes that happen to a
    particular virtual machine between multiple points in time.

  - Review the classification changes that happen to a virtual machine
    between two time checks.

  - Capture the configuration drifts for a single virtual machine across
    a time period.

## Remote Consoles

A console is a graphical window that allows you to view the start up
screen, shut down screen, and desktop of a virtual machine, and to
interact with that virtual machine in a similar way to a physical
machine.

ManageIQ offers the following support for HTML5-based VNC, SPICE, and
WebMKS consoles:

  - VNC and SPICE consoles for Red Hat Virtualization Manager with
    websocket proxy.

  - VMwareâ€™s WebMKS HTML5-based console type.

  - VNC consoles for OpenStack using OpenStack-supplied websocket proxy.

<div class="note">

  - VMware no longer supports the MKS console type. Also, VMRC is no
    longer a browser plugin but a native desktop application. As a
    result, the VMware MKS and the VMRC plugin options have been
    disabled in ManageIQ.

  - Currently, attempting to connect to the VMware WebMKS console for a
    virtual machine fails when the server security type is set to `2`
    for that virtual machine.

  - Due to VMware licensing restrictions, Red Hat cannot ship the WebMKS
    SDK in ManageIQ. For information on how to configure WebMKS support
    in ManageIQ, see [Configuring WebMKS Support in
    ManageIQ](#configuring-the-webmks-support).

</div>

All of the above make use of the websocket protocol supported by all
recent versions of browsers, and can use SSL to encrypt the websocket
connection.

  - OpenStack  
    ManageIQ only makes an API call to get the URL for the console and
    open that console in a web browser; see [Directly Connect to a VNC
    Console](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/instances-and-images-guide/#connect_to_an_instance)
    in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Instances and Images Guide* for
    more details.

  - Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager and VMware  
    By default, the websocket connection runs over HTTPS or HTTP based
    on how the application was accessed. Under an appliance, you will
    most likely use HTTPS, and, therefore, the websocket connection will
    be wss:// (websocket with SSL).
    
    When configuring Red Hat Virtualization Manager for virtual machine
    console access, set the display type for each virtual machine to
    `noVNC` or `SPICE HTML5`. For more information on configuring
    console options, see [Configuring Console
    Options](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-Configuring_Console_Options)
    in the Red Hat Virtualization *Virtual Machine Management Guide*.

### Configuring Console Access to VMware ESXi Hosts At A Network Layer

When configuring access to the VNC or HTML5 console, make sure that at a
network layer:

  - All VNC ports (5900-6000) are opened from the machine on which you
    access the ManageIQ Console to the ManageIQ.

  - All VNC ports (5900-6000) are opened from the ManageIQ to each
    VMware ESXi host running virtual machines that you want to access.

  - The firewall on VMware ESXi hosts is enabled and that the VMware
    ESXi host firewall ports are opened.

  - The VNC service (`gdbserver`) is running and that the `gdbserver`
    service has an association with ports 5900-6000 usually defined with
    a `/etc/vmware/firewall/service.xml` firewall rules configuration.
    
    The `gdbserver` ruleset must be enabled on each ESXi host running
    virtual machines that will be accessed through the HTML5 console or
    VNC console on the ManageIQ. The ruleset can be configured on the
    host itself, or using the VMware vCenter web user interface.

## Creating a Template Based on a Virtual Machine

A template is a copy of a virtual machine (VM) that you can use to
simplify the subsequent, repeated creation of similar VMs. Templates
capture the configuration of software, configuration of hardware, and
the software installed on the VM on which the template is based.

<div class="note">

Virtual machines must meet the following criteria to publish as
templates:

  - The VM must not be blank, archived or orphaned.

  - The VM must be associated with a oVirt Engine provider.

  - oVirt Engine provider 4.0 or higher, with `use_ovirt_engine_sdk` set
    to `true` in `/var/www/miq/vmdb/config/settings.yml` on your
    ManageIQ appliance.

  - The VM power state is `OFF`.

  - Sealing a template is not supported for Windows OS VMs.

</div>

To create a template based on an existing VM:

    2.  (Optional) Check **Seal Template**.
        
        <div class="note">
        
        Sealing, which uses the `virt-sysprep` command, removes
        system-specific details from a virtual machine before creating a
        template based on that VM. This prevents the original VMâ€™s
        details from appearing in subsequent VMs that are created using
        the same template. It also ensures the functionality of other
        features, such as predictable vNIC order.
        
        </div>
    
    3.  The **Number of VMs** indicates the output will be a single
        template.

# PXE Servers

PXE servers are used by ManageIQ to bootstrap virtual machines for the
purpose of provisioning. They include images for different operating
systems that can be customized using customization templates and are
used in conjunction with IPMI Servers.

# Availability Zones

An availability zone is a provider-specific method of grouping cloud
instances and services. ManageIQ uses Amazon EC2 regions and OpenStack
Nova zones as availability zones.

## Viewing an Availability Zone

You can click on an availability zone to view its details. The screen
provides you with an availability zone accordion and an availability
zone summary page.

  - You can choose between graphical or text view of the datastore
    summary.

  - Use the availability zone accordion to view the **Properties** of
    the zone and its **Relationships** to other cloud resources.

  - Use the availability zone summary to see details on
    **Relationships** (**Cloud Provider**, **Instances**) and **Smart
    Management** (**Company Tags**).

## Viewing Availability Zone Relationships

Use the availability zone accordionâ€™s **Relationship** section to see
items related to an availability zone.

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Clouds \>
    Availability Zones</span>.

2.  Click the availability zone to view the configuration.

3.  From the availability zone accordion, click **Relationships**.

4.  Click the type of resource relationship to view as a list.

# Cloud Tenants

A tenant is an OpenStack term for an organizational unit or project.
ManageIQ creates cloud tenants to match existing OpenStack tenants for
managing resources and controlling visibility of objects.

<div class="note">

OpenStack tenant mapping must be enabled for cloud tenants to be
created. See [Tenant Mapping](#tenant-mapping) for details.

</div>

OpenStack uses tenants for the following reasons:

  - Assigning users to a project

  - Defining quotas for a project

  - Applying access and security rules for a project

  - Managing resources and instances for a project

This helps administrators and users organize their OpenStack environment
and define limits for different groups of people. For example, one
project might require higher quotas and another project might require
restricted access to certain ports. OpenStack allows you to define these
limits and apply them to a project.

ManageIQ can abstract information from tenants including quotas and
relationships to other OpenStack objects.

To see multiple tenants in ManageIQ, the user authenticating to your
OpenStack environment from ManageIQ must be configured to have
visibility into these tenants.

<div class="note">

This section describes OpenStack cloud tenant usage. For information
about tenants created in ManageIQ for access and resource control, see
[Access
Control](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/general_configuration/#access-control)
in *General Configuration*.

</div>

## Tenant Mapping

When adding an OpenStack cloud or infrastructure provider, enable
*tenant mapping* in ManageIQ to map any existing tenants from that
provider.

This means ManageIQ will create new cloud tenants to match each existing
OpenStack tenant; each new cloud tenant and its corresponding OpenStack
tenant will have identical resource assignments (including user and role
synchronization) with the exception of quotas. Tenant quotas are not
synchronized between ManageIQ and OpenStack, and are available for
reporting purposes only. You can manage quotas in ManageIQ but this will
not affect the quotas created in OpenStack.

During a provider refresh, ManageIQ will also check for any changes to
the tenant list in OpenStack. ManageIQ will create new cloud tenants to
match any new tenants, and delete any cloud tenants whose corresponding
OpenStack tenants no longer exist. ManageIQ will also replicate any
changes to OpenStack tenants to their corresponding cloud tenants.

If you leave tenant mapping disabled, ManageIQ will not create cloud
tenants or tenant object hierarchy from OpenStack.

## Viewing Cloud Tenant Relationships

From <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Clouds \> Tenants</span>, click
on a specific cloud tenant to view its details.

The screen provides you with a cloud tenant accordion and a cloud tenant
summary.

  - Use cloud tenant summary views to change how you are looking at the
    **Summary**.

  - Use the cloud tenant accordion to view the **Properties** of the
    tenant and its **Relationships**.

  - Use the cloud tenant summary to see details on **Relationships**
    (**Cloud Provider**, **Security Groups**, **Instances**, and
    **Images**), **Quotas** (including all OpenStack **Compute**,
    **Network**, and **Volume** quotas) and **Smart Management**
    (**Company Tags**).

# Volumes

A volume is a block storage device that you can attach to or detach from
an instance to manage the storage available to that instance. Volumes
are managed through storage managers, which are added automatically to
ManageIQ when the corresponding provider is added.

# Flavors

Flavors indicate the resource profiles available for instances. Each
flavor contains a value set for CPUs, CPU cores and memory. Flavors
allow you to pre-configure resource settings, which you can then apply
during instance provisioning. You can also change the flavor of a
provisioned instance; see [Resizing an
Instance](#_to_resize_an_instance_via_flavor) for instructions.

ManageIQ provides the ability to view individual flavor information and
instances currently using the flavor.

# Cloud Networks

ManageIQ enables configuration and administration for the
software-defined networking component of Red Hat OpenStack Platform. The
virtual network infrastructure enables connectivity between instances
and the physical external network.

This section describes common cloud network administration tasks, such
as adding and removing subnets and routers to suit your Red Hat
OpenStack Platform providers.

## Creating and Administering Cloud Networks

Create a network to provide instances a place to communicate internally
and receive IP addresses using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP). A network can also be integrated with external networks in your
Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployment or elsewhere, such as the physical
network.

<div class="note">

  - Keystone API v3 is required to create cloud tenants on Red Hat
    OpenStack Platform cloud providers. For more information, see
    [OpenStack Identity
    (keystone)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html-single/architecture_guide/#comp-identity)
    in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Architecture Guide*.

  - For further details on cloud network objects and administration, see
    the [*Networking
    Guide*](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/12/html-single/networking_guide/#add_an_interface)
    in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform documentation..

## Creating and Administering Subnets

ManageIQ enables creation and administration of subnets for your cloud
networks. Create subnets in pre-existing networks as means to grant
network connectivity to instances. Subnets are the means by which
instances are granted network connectivity. Each instance is assigned to
a subnet as part of the instance creation process.

Consider proper placement of instances to best accommodate their
connectivity requirements:

  - Tenant networks in OpenStack Networking can host multiple subnets.

  - Subnets are isolated from one another.

  - Host distinctly different systems on different subnets within the
    same network.

  - Instances on one subnet that wish to communicate with another subnet
    must have traffic directed by a router.

  - Place systems requiring a high volume of traffic amongst themselves
    in the same subnet, avoiding routing and subsequent latency and load
    issues.

### Adding a Subnet

Add a subnet to an existing cloud network following the procedure below.

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Networks \> Subnets</span>.

2.  Click ![Configuration](images/1847.png)(**Configuration**), then
    click **Add a new Cloud Subnet**.

3.  Select a **Network Manager**.

4.  Under **Placement**, select a **Cloud Tenant**.

5.  Provide the following **Cloud Subnet** details:
    
    1.  A descriptive **Subnet Name**.
    
    2.  The **Gateway** IP address of the router interface for the
        default gateway.
    
    3.  **Enable DHCP** services for the subnet. DHCP allows automated
        distribution of IP settings to instances.
    
    4.  Select the **IP Version**. The IP address range in the Network
        Address field must match whichever version you select.
    
    5.  Input the **Subnet CIDR** address in CIDR format, which contains
        the IP address range and subnet mask in one value.
        
        <div class="note">
        
        Determine the address by calculating the number of bits masked
        in the subnet mask and append that value to the IP address
        range. For example, the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 has 24 masked
        bits. To use this mask with the IPv4 address range
        192.168.122.0, specify the address 192.168.122.0/24.
        
        </div>

### Editing a Cloud Subnet

To edit the details of a cloud subnet:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Networks \> Subnets</span>.

2.  Click on a subnet from the list view.

3.  Click ![Configuration](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![Edit this Cloud Subnet](images/1851.png) (**Edit this Cloud
    Subnet**).

4.  Edit **Cloud Subnet details** fields.

5.  Click **Save**.

## Configuring Network Routers

ManageIQ enables configuration for Red Hat OpenStack Platform provider
cloud network routing services using an SDN-based virtual router.

  - Routers are a requirement for your instances to communicate with
    external subnets, including those out in the physical network.

  - Routers and subnets connect using interfaces, with each subnet
    requiring its own interface to the router.

  - A routerâ€™s default gateway defines the next hop for any traffic
    received by the router.

  - A routerâ€™s network is typically configured to route traffic to the
    external physical network using a virtual bridge.

### Adding a Network Router

Add a network router to an existing cloud network by following the
procedure below.

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Networks \> Network
    Routers</span>.

## Creating Floating IPs

Floating IP addresses allow you to direct ingress network traffic to
your cloud network instances. Define a pool of validly routable external
IP addresses, which can then be dynamically assigned to an instance. All
incoming traffic destined for that floating IP is routed to the instance
to which it has been assigned.

<div class="note">

Red Hat OpenStack Networking allocates floating IP addresses to all
projects (tenants) from the same IP ranges/CIDRs. As a result, every
subnet of floating IPs is consumable by any and all projects. Manage
this behavior using quotas for specific projects.

# Instances and Images

**Images** are the static templates containing the software
configuration from which you provision a running **Instance** - a
virtual machine, with which you can interact - on your cloud provider.

The **Instance** and **Images** containers, combined with the ability to
analyze information inside each instance or image, provides in-depth
information across the cloud environment. This rich set of information
enables ManageIQ users to improve problem resolution times and
effectively manage instances and images in their cloud environment.

The **Instances** and **Images** pages display all instances and images
the server discovered from your cloud providers. The taskbar on each
page is a menu driven set of buttons that provide access to functions
related to instances and images.

## Resizing an Instance

ManageIQ allows you to resize an existing, active instance by changing
its flavor. This is only possible if your OpenStack deployment has:

  - At least two Compute nodes, or with resizing to the same host
    enabled

  - Enough capacity to support the needs of the new flavor

<div class="note">

Keep in mind that the instance will undergo a controlled shutdown when
you change its flavor.

For more information about the requirements and underlying OpenStack
process involved, see [Resize an
Instance](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/instances-and-images-guide/#section-resize-instance)
in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Instances and Images Guide*.

</div>

To resize an instance through ManageIQ:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Clouds \>
    Instances</span>.

2.  Click the instance whose flavor you want to change.

3.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then

    want from the **Choose Flavor** dropdown.

5.  Click **Submit**. Doing so will initiate the flavor change, and it
    might take several minutes before ManageIQ verifies whether the
    change was successful.

See [Flavors](#flavors) and [Manage
Flavors](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/instances-and-images-guide/#section-flavors)
in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Instances and Images Guide* for more
information.

## Migrating a Live Instance

*Live migration* involves moving a live instance between Compute nodes.
Live migration is useful for avoiding instance downtime during cloud
maintenance or load management. See [How to Migrate a Live
Instance](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/version-8/migrating-instances/#how_to_migrate_a_live_instance)
in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Migrating Instances* guide for
details on the underlying OpenStack process.

To migrate a live instance:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Clouds \>
    Instances</span>.

2.  On the right pane, click the instance to be migrated. Use the
    **Instances by Provider** accordion to filter instances by provider
    and/or availability zone.

3.  Click ![2007](images/2007.png)(**Lifecycle**), then
    ![2097](images/2097.png) (**Migrate selected Instance**).

4.  On the **Migrate Instance** section, select your preferred migration
    options:
    
      - **Auto-select Host?**: let the OpenStack provider automatically
        choose a destination Compute node. If you prefer to choose a
        specific node, uncheck this option and choose from the
        **Destination Host** dropdown.
    
      - **Block Migration**: check this option to perform a
        *block-based* migration. With this migration, the entire virtual
        machine image is moved from the source node to the destination
        node. If your OpenStack provider uses *shared storage*, leave
        this option unchecked. See
        [Prerequisites](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/version-8/migrating-instances/#prerequisites)
        in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Migrating Instances* guide
        for related information.
    
      - **Disk Over Commit**: check this option to prevent the OpenStack
        provider from verifying first whether the destination host has
        available disk space to host the instance.

5.  Click **Submit**.

Once the migration initiates, the instance list will reload with a
message indicating that the selected instance is being migrated. Upon
completion, the instance list will reload and the evacuated instance
will be displayed as ![2143](images/2143.png) (**On**).

## Evacuating an Instance

If a Compute node is shut down, you can *evacuate* instances hosted on
it. This is only useful if the instances use shared storage or block
storage volumes. See [Evacuate
Instances](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/instances-and-images-guide/#section-migration-evacuation)
in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Instances and Images Guide* for
details on the underlying OpenStack process.

To evacuate an instance:

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Clouds \>
    Instances</span>.

2.  On the right pane, click the instance to be evacuated. Use the
    **Instances by Provider** accordion to filter instances by provider
    and/or availability zone.

3.  Click ![2007](images/2007.png)(**Lifecycle**), then
    ![2097](images/2097.png)(**Evacuate selected Instance**).

4.  On the **Evacuate Host** section, select your preferred evacuation
    options:
    
      - **Auto-select Host?**: let the OpenStack provider automatically
        choose a destination Compute node. If you prefer to choose a
        specific node, uncheck this option and choose from the
        **Destination Host** dropdown.
    
      - **On Shared Storage**: leave this checked to indicate that all
        instance files are on shared storage.

5.  Click **Submit**.

Once the evacuation initiates, the instance list will reload with a
message indicating that the selected instance is being evacuated. Upon
completion, the instance list will reload and the evacuated instance
will be displayed as ![2143](images/2143.png) (**On**).

        event groups to display. Each has its own color.
    
      - From the **Level** dropdown, select either a **Summary** event
        or a **Detail** list of events. For example, the detail level of
        a **Power On** event might include the power on request, the
        starting event, and the actual **Power On** event. If you select
        **Summary**, you only see the **Power On** event in the
        timeline.

5.  To see more detail on an item in the timeline, click on it. A
    balloon appears with a clickable link to the resource.

## Viewing the Instance or Image Summary

When you click on a specific instance or image, you will see the
**Virtual Thumbnail**, and an operating system-specific summary screen
of the item. Where applicable, click on a subcategory of the summary to
see more detail on that section.

The summary page contains the following categories:

  - **Properties** include information such as the base operating
    system, hostname, IP addresses, instance vendor, cloud resources,
    and snapshots. This includes the ability to analyze multiple
    partitions, multiple disks, Linux logical volumes, extended
    partitions, and Windows drives. Some categories can be clicked on
    for additional detail. For example, click **Container** to view
    notes associated with an instance.

  - **Lifecycle** shows the date of discovery and the last analysis. If
    a retirement date and time or owner has been set, these display as
    well.

  - **Relationships** include information on the instanceâ€™s cloud
    provider, genealogy such as parent and child instances, and drift.

  - **VMsafe** shows properties of the VMsafe agent if it is enabled.

  - **Compliance** shows the status of system compliance checks and
    history of past checks.

  - **Power Management** displays the current power state, last boot
    time, and last power state change. **State Changed On** is the date
    that the instance last changed its power state. This is a container
    view of the power state, therefore a restart of the operating system
    does not cause the container power state to change and does not
    update this value.

  - **Security** includes information on users and groups.

  - **Configuration** includes information on applications, services,
    packages, init processes, and files. This section changes depending
    on the base operating system.

  - **Diagnostics** provides a link to viewing running processes and the
    information from the latest collected event logs.

  - **Smart Management** shows all tags assigned to this instance.

Performing a SmartState Analysis on an instance or image provides more
detailed information in these categories.

## Detecting Drift on Instances or Images

The configuration of an instance might change over time. **Drift** is
the comparison of an instance to itself at different points in time. The
instance needs to be analyzed at least twice to collect this
information. Detecting drift provides you the following benefits:

  - See the difference between the last known state of a machine and its
    current state.

  - Review the configuration changes that happen to a particular
    instance between multiple points in time.

  - Review the association changes that happen to a particular instance
    between multiple points in time.

  - Review the classification changes that happen to an instance between
    two time checks.

  - Capture the configuration drifts for a single instance across a time
    period.

    an icon representing the property depends on the properties type.
    
      - A property displayed in the same color as the base means the
        compared analysis matches the base for that property.
    
      - A property displayed in a different color from the base means
        the compared analysis does not match the base for that property.

10. If you are in the **Compressed View** ![2024](images/2024.png), the
    values of the properties are not displayed. All items are described
    by the icons shown below.
    
      - A ![2150](images/2150.png) (**checkmark**) means that the
        compared analysis matches the base for that property. If you
        hover over it, the value of the property will display.
    
      - A ![2177](images/2177.png) (**triangle**) means the compared
        analysis does not match the base for that property. If you hover
        over it, the value of the property displays. Click the minus
        sign next to the sections name to collapse it.

        values**) to see only the attributes that are different across
        the drifts.
    
      - Click ![2148](images/2148.png) (**Attributes with the same
        values**) to see only the attributes that are the same across
        drifts.

12. To limit the mode of the view, there are two buttons in the
    **Resource** button area.
    
      - Click ![2022](images/2022.png) (**Details Mode**) to see all
        details for an attribute.
    
      - Click ![2025](images/2025.png) (**Exists Mode**) to only see if
        an attribute exists compared to the base or not. This only
        applies to attributes that can have a Boolean property. For
        example, a user account exists or does not exist, or a piece of
        hardware that does or does not exist.

containers providers.

## The Containers Overview Page

The containers overview page shows information on all containers
providers and entities known to ManageIQ. The **Overview** page provides
links to other summary pages which contain further information on the
containers providers and entities. The **Overview** page also provides
metrics for **Aggregated Node Utilization**, **Network Utilization
Trend**, **New Image Usage Trend**, **Node Utilization**, and **Pod
Creation and Deletion Trends**.

![Containers Overview](images/containers-overview.png)

1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Containers \>
    Overview</span>.

2.  Click the desired containers entity, or provider, if applicable, for
    viewing the summary with further information.

<div class="note">

To reliably associate pods and images, ManageIQ requires information
from the `docker-pullable` field, added in OpenShift 3.3.1.2. This can
affect the results of the **Chargeback by Image** report for older
OpenShift providers, and potentially cause image inspection (done as
part of Smart State Analysis) to fail due to associating a container to
the wrong image. Consequently, ManageIQ may not report accurate
information about pods and images in OpenShift providers before version
3.3.1.2.

</div>

## Configuring Automatic Tagging for Container Entities

Container object labels in OpenShift can be used to automatically create
tags and tag categories in ManageIQ. This is done by mapping ManageIQ
tags to existing OpenShift or Kubernetes labels.

Labels from OpenShift can be mapped to ManageIQ tags for the following
container entities:

  - Projects

  - Nodes

  - Routes

  - Replicators

  - Container services

  - Pods

  - Container builds

<div class="note">

Tags automatically created from OpenShift labels are completely managed
by the ManageIQ system and cannot be manually assigned or unassigned.
Deleting a mapping rule from ManageIQ immediately deletes the resulting
tags.

</div>

You can view a container entityâ€™s OpenShift labels on the entityâ€™s
details page under **Labels**.

The following example shows how to configure tagging for a node, but the
same steps can be used for mapping labels to tags on other container
entities.

To configure automatic tagging on container entities using labels:

1.  Note the *key* of the OpenShift label you want to map to a ManageIQ
    tag. OpenShift labels consist of two parts: a *key* and a *value*.
    
    1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Containers \>
        Nodes</span>.
    
    2.  Select a node to open its summary page.
    
    3.  Under **Labels**, note the label(s) to map to ManageIQ tag(s).
        Any OpenShift labels will list the *key* in the left column of
        the **Labels** table, and the *value* in the right column of the
        **Labels** table.
        
        This node has six labels (key/value pairs) that were created in
        OpenShift and collected in the ManageIQ inventory:
        
        ![OCPnode summary](images/OCPnode-summary.png)
        
        <div class="note">
        
        To create an OpenShift label, see [Developer CLI
        Operations](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html)
        in the OpenShift Container Platform *CLI Reference* guide. A new
        label added in OpenShift will only show up in ManageIQ after the
        next OpenShift provider refresh.
        
        </div>

2.  Navigate to **Configuration** and select the region.

3.  Click the **Map Tags** tab.

4.  Click **Add** to create a new mapping rule.
    
    1.  Select a container entity to tag from the **Entity** list, or
        select **\<All\>** to tag all entities.
    
    2.  Specify the *key* from the OpenShift label you noted earlier in
        the **Label** field.
    
    3.  Specify a ManageIQ tag category in **Category** to map the label
        to. If the tag category does not exist yet in ManageIQ, it will
        be created automatically.
        
        ![Add label mapping](images/Add_label_mapping.png)
    
    4.  Click **Add**. The mapping will show in the table on the **Map
        Tags** tab.

5.  Refresh the provider to complete the mapping:
    
    1.  Navigate to <span class="menuchoice">Compute \> Containers \>
        Providers</span>.
    
    2.  Select the provider to refresh.
    
    3.  Click ![1847](images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
        ![2003](images/2003.png) (**Refresh Items and Relationships**).

The label will display on the entityâ€™s summary page under **Smart
Management** under **Company Tags** as `<Category> : <value>`.

![OCP autotagged](images/OCP-autotagged.png)

Any container entity with the OpenShift `zone` label will be tagged
automatically as `category1` in ManageIQ. If the *value* for `zone` is
`south`, for example, the entity will be tagged as `category1 : south`.

You can use these tags to create reports. See [Monitoring, Alerts, and
Reporting](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.7/single/monitoring-alerts-and-reporting/)
for details on creating reports.

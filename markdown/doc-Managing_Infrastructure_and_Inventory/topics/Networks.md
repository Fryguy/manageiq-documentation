# Creating and Administering Cloud Networks

Create a network to provide instances a place to communicate internally
and receive IP addresses using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP). A network can also be integrated with external networks in your
Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployment or elsewhere, such as the physical
network.

Policies are used to manage your virtual environment. There are two
types of policies available: compliance and control. Compliance policies
are used to harden your virtual infrastructure, making sure that your
security requirements are adhered to. Control policies are used to check
for a specific condition and perform an action based on the outcome. For
example:

  - Prevent virtual machines from running without an administrator
    account.

  - Prevent virtual machines from starting if certain patches are not
    applied.

  - Configure the behavior of a production virtual machine to only start
    if it is running on a production host.

  - Force a SmartState Analysis when a host is added or removed from a
    cluster.

  - With Keystone API v3, domains are used to determine administrative
    boundaries of service entities in OpenStack. Domains allow you to
    group users together for various purposes, such as setting
    domain-specific configuration or security options. For more
    information, see [OpenStack Identity
    (keystone)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html-single/architecture_guide/#comp-identity)
    in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Architecture Guide*.

  - The provider you are creating will be able to see projects for the
    given domain only. To see projects for other domains, add it as
    another cloud provider. For more information on domain management in
    OpenStack, see [Domain
    Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#Domains)
    in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Users and Identity Management
    Guide*.

Two types of storage managers are currently available to
{product-title}: OpenStack Block Storage (`openstack-cinder`) and
OpenStack Object Storage (`openstack-swift`). OpenStack Block Storage
provisions and manages block storage, whereas OpenStack Object Storage
manages object storage within the cloud. These storage managers are
discovered automatically by {product-title} after adding an OpenStack
cloud provider.

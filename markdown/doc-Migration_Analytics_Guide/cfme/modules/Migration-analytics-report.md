**Initial savings estimation.**

This section describes the estimated savings realized by migrating from

data retrieved from the infrastructure. The savings estimates are broken
down into VMware maintenance costs, Red Hat Virtualization costs, and
Red Hat training and services.

**Workload migration summary.**

This section describes the complexity of the migration and provides
detailed workload data. A pie chart displays the complexity of
migrations:

  - **Easy**: Virtual machine with no unusual configuration

  - **Medium**: For example, virtual machine with more than four vNICs
    or a shared disk

  - **Hard**: For example, a virtual machine with Raw Device Mapping

  - **Unsupported**: Operating system is not supported for migration,
    for example, FreeBSD 12

**Workload migration inventory.**

This section displays a list of the virtual machines to be migrated,
with detailed information about each virtual machineâ€™s workload,
operating system, estimated migration effort, and recommended migration
targets.

In this section, you can filter the list of virtual machines by fields
or click **Export as CSV** to save the report to your local machine.
